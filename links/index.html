          <li><a href="http://www.swox.com/gmp/">GMP</a> is GNU
          Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library. It supports
          arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
          integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.
          GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible, both
          for small operands and for huge operands. The speed is
          achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type,
          by using fast algorithms, with highly optimized assembly
          code for the most common inner loops for a lot of CPUs,
          and by a general emphasis on speed. Probably it is
          <em>the fastest bignum library</em>.</li>

          is a widely used computer algebra system designed for
          fast computations in number theory (factorizations,
          algebraic number theory, elliptic curves...), but also
          contains a large number of other useful functions to
          compute with mathematical entities such as matrices,
          polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers, etc., and a
          lot of transcendental functions. PARI is also available

          is a computer algebra system based on DOE Macsyma. The
          source code is available. It has abilities such as
          symbolic integration, 3D plotting, and an ODE solver, but
          there is a lot of work yet to be done in terms of bug
          fixing, cleanup, and documentation.</li>

          for research and development of mathematical algorithms.
          It defines a strongly typed, mathematically correct type
          hierarchy. It has a programming language and a built-in

          is a BASIC-like environment which is suitable for number
          theoretic investigations. UBASIC has the high precision
          integer, real and complex arithmetic, exact rational
          arithmetic and arithmetic of polynomials with complex,
          rational, or modulo p coefficients, as well as string
          handling and limited list handling capabilities. It runs
          under MS-DOS and is written in assembly language. It is
          really very nice and powerfull language. See <a href=

          <li>Project <a href="http://linalg.org/">LINBOX</a> is a

          black box matrix methods, i.e. iterative methods
          requiring only the linear transform property of the
          matrix (that one can compute Ax --&gt; y). No stable
